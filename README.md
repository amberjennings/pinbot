# Pinbot

Dependencies: pyyaml, py-cord

Currently sends an embedded version of messages, as well as their first attachment, that have a pushpin (ðŸ“Œ) reaction to a channel defined in rb.yaml (see rb.yaml.example).

Todo:
- [ ] Allow bot to distinguish between multiple servers
- [ ] Don't re-send pins when more pushpin reactions are applied
